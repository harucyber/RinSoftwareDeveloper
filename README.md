# Rin

Hello everyone! I'm a student and coding hobbyist and currently an Intern at MEGA Education as an Junior Software Developer.
I have been coding for approximately 3 years (since 2019 on scratch) and active works to improve my own skills in programming.

I have an interest in Logistics and Management as well and looking for paths in economics!
